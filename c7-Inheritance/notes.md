# Inheritance

Inheritance is **one of the three foundation principles** of **object-oriented programming** because it **allows the creation of hierarchical classifications.**. Using inheritance, you can create a general class that defines **traits common** to a set of **related items**.

This class can then be inherited by other, more specific classes, each adding those things that are unique to it. In Java, a **class tha is inherited** is called a **superclass**. The **class that does the inheriting** is called a **subclass**.

Therefore, a **subclass** is a specialized vversion of a superclass. It **inherits** all of the **variables** and **methods** defined by the superclass and adds its own, unique elements.

## Inheritance Basics

Java supports inheritance by **allowing one class to incorporate another class into its declaration**.This is done by using the **extends** keyword.
Thus, the subclass adds to (extends) the superclass

**_class subclass-name extends superclass-name {\
// body of class\
}_**

```Java
// A simple class hierarchy
// A class for two-dimensional objects
class TwoDShape {
    double width;
    double height;

    void showDim() {
        System.out.println("Width and height are " + width + " and " + height);
    }
}

/*
 * A sub class of TwoDShape for triangles
 * Triangle inherits TwoDShape
 */
class Triangle extends TwoDShape {
    String style;

    /*
     * Triangle can refer to the members of TwoDShape
     * as if they were declared by Triangle
     */
    double area() {
        return width * height / 2;
    }

    void showStyle() {
        System.out.println("Triangle is " + style);
    }
}

class Rectangle extends TwoDShape {
    boolean isSquare() {
        if (width == height)
            return true;
        return false;
    }

    double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

class Shapes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Triangle t1 = new Triangle();
        Triangle t2 = new Triangle();
        Rectangle r1 = new Rectangle();
        Rectangle r2 = new Rectangle();

        /*
         * All members of Triangle are available to Triangle
         * objects, even those inherited from TwoDShape
         */
        t1.width = 4.0;
        t1.height = 4.0;
        t1.style = "filled";

        t2.width = 8.0;
        t2.height = 12.0;
        t2.style = "outlined";

        System.out.println("Info for t1: ");
        t1.showStyle();
        t1.showDim();
        System.out.println("Area is " + t1.area());

        System.out.println();

        System.out.println("Info for t2: ");
        t2.showStyle();
        t2.showDim();
        System.out.println("Area is " + t2.area());

        System.out.println();
        // Rectangle
        r1.width = 4.0;
        r1.height = 8.0;

        r2.width = 4.0;
        r2.height = 4.0;

        System.out.println("Info for r1: ");
        System.out.println("Is a square : " + r1.isSquare());
        r1.showDim();
        System.out.println("Area is " + r1.area());

        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("Info for r2: ");
        System.out.println("Is a square : " + r2.isSquare());
        r2.showDim();
        System.out.println("Area is " + r2.area());
    }
}
```

Because **Triangle includes all of the members of its superclass**, TwoDShape, it can access width and height inside area( ). Also, inside main( ), objects t1 and t2 can refer to width and height directly, as if they were declared by Triangle.

You can specify **only one superclass for any subclass** that you create. **Java does not support the inheritance of multiple superclasses into a single subclass**

You can, however, create a **hierarchy of inheritance in which a subclass becomes a superclass of another subclass**. Of course, **no class can be a superclass of itself**.

A major advantage of **inheritance** is that once you have created a superclass that **defines the attributes common to a set of objects**, it can be used to **create any number of more specific subclasses**

## Member Access and Inheritance

Inheriting a class does not averrule the **private** access restriction. Thus, even though a **subclass** includes all the members of its superclass, it **cannot access** those **members** of the **superclass** that have been declared **private**.

```Java
// Private members are not inherited.
// This example will not compile.
// A class for two-dimensional objects.
class TwoDShape {
    private double width; // these are
    private double height; // now private
    void showDim() {
        System.out.println("Width and height are " +
        width + " and " + height);
    }
}
// A subclass of TwoDShape for triangles.
class Triangle extends TwoDShape {
    String style;
    double area() {
        return width * height / 2; //Error Canâ€™t access a private member
    }
    void showStyle() {
        System.out.println("Triangle is " + style);
    }
}
```

**Accessor methods** are needed to provide access the private class members. The sollowingg example illustrates it.

```Java
// Use accessor methods to set and get private members.
//A class for two-dimensional objects
class TwoDShape {
    // These are now private
    private double width;
    private double height;

    // Accessor methods for width and height
    double getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    double getHeight() {
        return height;
    }

    void setWidth(double w) {
        width = w;
    }

    void setHeight(double h) {
        height = h;
    }

    void showDim() {
        System.out.println("Width and height are " + width + " and " + height);

    }
}

// A subclass of TwoDShape for triangles.
class Triangle extends TwoDShape {
    String style;

    double area() {
        return getWidth() * getHeight() / 2;
    }

    void showStyle() {
        System.out.println("Triangle is " + style);
    }
}

class Shapes2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Triangle t1 = new Triangle();
        Triangle t2 = new Triangle();

        t1.setWidth(4.0);
        t1.setHeight(4.0);
        t1.style = "filled";

        t2.setWidth(8.0);
        t2.setHeight(12.0);
        t2.style = "outlined";

        System.out.println("Info for t1: ");
        t1.showStyle();
        t1.showDim();
        System.out.println("Area is " + t1.area());
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("Info for t2: ");
        t2.showStyle();
        t2.showDim();
        System.out.println("Area is " + t2.area());

    }
}
```

## Constructors and Inheritance

In a hierarchy, its possible for both superclasses and subclasses to have their own constructors.The **constructor for the superclass constructs the superclass portion** of the object, and the **constructor for the subclass constructs the subclass part**, their construction must be **separate**.

The sollowing exampple illustrates it.

```Java
// Add a constructor to Triangle
//A class for two-dimensional objects
class TwoDShape {
    // These are now private
    private double width;
    private double height;

    // Accessor methods for width and height
    double getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    double getHeight() {
        return height;
    }

    void setWidth(double w) {
        width = w;
    }

    void setHeight(double h) {
        height = h;
    }

    void showDim() {
        System.out.println("Width and height are " + width + " and " + height);
    }
}

// A subclass of TwoDShape for triangles
class Triangle extends TwoDShape {
    private String style;

    // Constructor
    Triangle(String s, double w, double h) {
        // Initialize TwoDShape portion of object
        setWidth(w);
        setHeight(h);
        style = s;
    }

    double area() {
        return getWidth() * getHeight() / 2;
    }

    void showStyle() {
        System.out.println("Triangle is " + style);
    }
}

class Shapes3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Triangle t1 = new Triangle("filled", 4.0, 4.0);
        Triangle t2 = new Triangle("outlined", 8.0, 12.0);

        System.out.println("Info for t1: ");
        t1.showStyle();
        t1.showDim();
        System.out.println("Area is " + t1.area());
        System.out.println();

        System.out.println("Info for t2: ");
        t2.showStyle();
        t2.showDim();
        System.out.println("Area is " + t2.area());
    }
}
```

## Using super to Call Superclass Constructors

A **subclass can call a constructor defined by its superclass** by use of the following form os **super**.

**_super(parameter-list)_**

Here, _parameter list_ specifies any parameters neede by the constructor in the superclass. **super() must always be the first statement executed inside a subclass constructor**.

```Java
// Add constructors to TwoDShape
class TwoDShape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    // Parameterized constructor
    TwoDShape(double w, double h) {
        width = w;
        height = h;
    }

    // Accessor methods for width and height
    double getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    double getHeight() {
        return height;
    }

    // void setWidth(double w) {
    // width = w;
    // }

    // void setHeight(double h) {
    // height = h;
    // }

    void showDim() {
        System.out.println("Width and height are " + width + " and " + height);
    }
}

// A subclass of TwoDShape for triangles
class Triangle extends TwoDShape {
    private String style;

    Triangle(String s, double w, double h) {
        super(w, h);// call superclass constructor
        style = s;
    }

    double area() {
        return getWidth() * getHeight() / 2;
    }

    void showStyle() {
        System.out.println("Triangle is " + style);
    }
}

class Shapes4 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Triangle t1 = new Triangle("filled", 4.0, 4.0);
        Triangle t2 = new Triangle("outlined", 8.0, 12.0);

        System.out.println("Info for t1: ");
        t1.showStyle();
        t1.showDim();
        System.out.println("Area is " + t1.area());
        System.out.println();

        System.out.println("Info for t2: ");
        t2.showStyle();
        t2.showDim();
        System.out.println("Area is " + t2.area());
    }
}
```

Here **Triangle() calls super()** with the parameters **w and h**. This causes the **TwoDShape()** constructor to be **called** which **initiliizes width and height** using these values.

**The key point is that once you have created a superclass that defines the general aspects
of an object, that superclass can be inherited to form specialized classes. Each subclass
simply adds its own, unique attributes. This is the essence of inheritance.**

## Creating a Multilevel Hierarchy

You can build hierarchies that contain as **many layers of inheritance**
as you like. **It is perfectly acceptable to use a subclass as a superclass of another**.

Because of inheritance, ColorTriangle can make use of the previously defined classes of Triangle and TwoDShape, adding only the extra information it needs for its own, specific application. **This is part of the value of inheritance; it allows the reuse of code**.

**super( ) always refers to the constructor in the closest superclass;**

```Java
// A multilevel hierarchy
class TwoDShape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    // A default constructor
    TwoDShape() {
        width = height = 0.0;
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    TwoDShape(double w, double h) {
        width = w;
        height = h;
    }

    // Constructor object with equl width and height
    TwoDShape(double x) {
        width = height = x;
    }

    // Accessor methods for width and height
    double getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    double getHeight() {
        return height;
    }

    void setWidth(double w) {
        width = w;
    }

    void setHeight(double h) {
        height = h;
    }

    void showDim() {
        System.out.println("Width and height are " + width + " and " + height);
    }
}

// Extends TwoDShape
class Triangle extends TwoDShape {
    private String style;

    // A default constructor
    Triangle() {
        super();
        style = "none";
    }

    // Constructor
    Triangle(String s, double w, double h) {
        super(w, h);// Call superclass constructor
        style = "filled";
    }

    // One argument constructor
    Triangle(double x) {
        super(x);// call superclass constructor
        style = "filled";
    }

    double area() {
        return getWidth() * getHeight() / 2;
    }

    void showStyle() {
        System.out.println("Triangle is " + style);
    }
}

/*
 * Extend Triangle
 * ColorTriangle inherits Triangle, which
 * is descended from TwoDShape, so
 * ColorTriangle includes all members
 * of Triangle and TwoDShape.
 */
class ColorTriangle extends Triangle {
    private String color;

    ColorTriangle(String c, String s, double w, double h) {
        super(s, w, h);
        color = c;
    }

    String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    void showColor() {
        System.out.println("Color is " + color);
    }
}

class Shapes6 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ColorTriangle t1 = new ColorTriangle("Blue", "outlined", 8.0, 12.0);
        ColorTriangle t2 = new ColorTriangle("Red", "filled", 2.0, 2.0);

        System.out.println("Info fot t1: ");
        t1.showStyle();
        t1.showDim();
        t1.showColor();
        System.out.println("Area is " + t1.area());
        System.out.println();

        System.out.println("Info fot t2: ");
        t2.showStyle();
        t2.showDim();
        t2.showColor();
        System.out.println("Area is " + t2.area());
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

## When Are Constructors Executed?

In a class hierarchy, constructors complete their execution in order of derivation, **from superclass to subclass**. If super( ) is not used, then the default (parameterless) constructor of each superclass will be executed.

```Java
//Demonstrate when constructors are executed
//Create a super class
class A {
    A() {
        System.out.println("Constructing A.");
    }
}

// Create a subclass by extending class A
class B extends A {
    B() {
        System.out.println("Constructing B.");
    }
}

// Create another subclass by extending B
class C extends B {
    C() {
        System.out.println("Constructing C.");
    }
}

class OrderOfConstruction {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C c = new C();
    }

}
```

Output:\
Constructing A.\
Constructing B.\
Constructing C.

## Superclass References and Subclass Objects

**Java is a strongly typed language**. Aside from the standard conversions and automatic promotions that apply to its primitive types, **type compatibility is strictly enforced**. Therefore, **a reference variable for one class type cannot normally refer to an object of another class type**.

```Java
//This will not compile
class X {
    int a;

    X(int i) {
        a = i;
    }
}

class Y {
    int a;

    Y(int i) {
        a = i;
    }
}

class IncompatibleRef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        X x = new X(10);
        X x2;
        Y y = new Y(5);
        x2 = x; // OK, both the same type
        x2 = y; // Error, not the same type. Cannot convert from Y to X
    }
}

```

Even though class X and class Y are structurally the same, **it is not possible to assign an X reference to a Y object** because they have **different types**. In general, **an object reference variable can refer only to objects of its type**.

**A superclass reference can refer to a subclass object**.

```Java
// A superclass reference can refer to a subclass object
class X {
    int a;

    X(int i) {
        a = i;
    }
}

class Y extends X {
    int b;

    Y(int i, int j) {
        super(j);
        b = i;
    }
}

class SupSubRef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        X x = new X(10);
        X x2;
        Y y = new Y(5, 6);

        x2 = x; // OK, both the same type
        System.out.println("x2.a: " + x2.a);
        x2 = y;// Still OK because Y is derived from X;
        System.out.println("x2.a " + x2.a);
        // X references know only about X members
        x2.a = 19; // OK
        // x2.b = 27 //Error, X doesn't have a b member
    }
}
```

Output:\
x2.a: 10\
x2.a 6

Here, **Y is now derived from X;thus, it is permissible for x2 to be assigned a reference to a Y object**. It is important to understand that it is the type of the reference variable, not the type of the object that refers to , that determines what members can be accessed.

An important place where subclass references are assigned to superclass variables is when **constructors are called in a class hierarchy**

```Java
class TwoDShape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    // A default constructor
    TwoDShape() {
        width = height = 0.0;
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    TwoDShape(double w, double h) {
        width = w;
        height = h;
    }

    // Construct an object with equal width and height
    TwoDShape(double x) {
        width = height = x;
    }

    // Construct an object from an object.
    TwoDShape(TwoDShape ob) {
        width = ob.width;
        height = ob.height;
    }

    // Accessor methods for width and height
    double getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    double getHeight() {
        return height;
    }

    void setWidth(double w) {
        width = w;
    }

    void setHeight(double h) {
        height = h;
    }

    void showDim() {
        System.out.println("Width and height are " + width + " and " + height);
    }
}

// A subclass of TwoDShape for triangles
class Triangle extends TwoDShape {
    private String style;

    // A default contructor
    Triangle() {
        super();
        style = "none";
    }

    // Constructor for Triangle
    Triangle(String s, double w, double h) {
        super(w, h);// Call superclass constructor
        style = s;
    }

    // One argument constructor
    Triangle(double x) {
        super(x);// call superclass constructor
        style = "filled";
    }

    // COnstruct an object from an object
    Triangle(Triangle ob) {
        super(ob); // Pass object to TwoDShape constructor
        style = ob.style;
    }

    double area() {
        return getWidth() * getHeight() / 2;
    }

    void showStyle() {
        System.out.println("Triangle is " + style);
    }
}

class Shapes7 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Triangle t1 = new Triangle("outlined", 8.0, 12.0);
        // make a copy of t1
        Triangle t2 = new Triangle(t1);

        System.out.println("Info fot t1: ");
        t1.showStyle();
        t1.showDim();
        System.out.println("Area is " + t1.area());
        System.out.println();

        System.out.println("Info fot t2: ");
        t2.showStyle();
        t2.showDim();
        System.out.println("Area is " + t2.area());
        System.out.println();

    }
}
```

Output:\
Info fot t1: \
Triangle is outlined\
Width and height are 8.0 and 12.0\
Area is 48.0

Info fot t2: \
Triangle is outlined\
Width and height are 8.0 and 12.0\
Area is 48.0

The key point is that TwoDshape( ) is expecting a TwoDShape object. However, Triangle( ) passes it a Triangle object. The reason this works is because, as explained, a superclass reference can refer to a subclass object. Thus, it is perfectly acceptable to pass TwoDShape( ) a reference to an object of a class derived from TwoDShape. Because the TwoDShape( ) constructor is initializing only those portions of the subclass object that are members of TwoDShape, it doesnâ€™t matter that the object might also contain other members added by derived classes.

## Method Overriding

In a class hierarchy, when a **method in a subclass has the same return type and signature as a method in its superclass**, then the **method in the subclass is said to override the method in the superclass**. When an overridden method is called from within a subclass, it will always refer to the version of that method defined by the subclass.

```Java
//Method overriding
class A {
    int i, j;

    A(int a, int b) {
        i = a;
        j = b;
    }

    // display i and j
    void show() {
        System.out.println("i and j: " + i + " " + j);
    }
}

class B extends A {
    int k;

    B(int a, int b, int c) {
        super(a, b);
        k = c;
    }

    // display k - this overrides show() in A
    void show() {
        super.show(); // this calss A's show()
        System.out.println("k: " + k);
    }
}

class Override {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        B subOb = new B(1, 2, 3);
        subOb.show(); // this calls show() in B
    }
}

## Method Overloading

Method **overriding** occurs only when the **signatures of the two methods are identical**. **If they are not**, then the two methods are simply **overloaded**

```Java
/*
 * Methods with differing signatures
 * are overloaded and not overridden
 */
class A {
    int i, j;

    A(int a, int b) {
        i = a;
        j = b;
    }

    // display i and j
    void show() {
        System.out.println("i and j: " + i + " " + j);
    }
}

// Create a subclass by extending class A
class B extends A {
    int k;

    B(int a, int b, int c) {
        super(a, b);
        k = c;
    }

    // overload show()
    void show(String msg) {
        System.out.println(msg + k);
    }
}

class Overload {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        B subOb = new B(1, 2, 3);
        subOb.show("This is k: "); // this calss show() in B
        subOb.show();// This calls show() in A
    }
}
```

The version of show( ) in B takes a string parameter. This makes its signature different from the one in A, which takes no parameters. Therefore, no overriding (or name hiding) takes place.

## Overridden Methods Support Polymorphism

Method overriding forms the basis for one of Javaâ€™s most powerful concepts: **dynamic method dispatch**. Dynamic method dispatch is the **mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time rather than compile time,** this is how Java implements run-time polymorphism.

A superclass reference variable can refer to a subclass object. **When an overridden method is called through a superclass reference**, Java determines which version of that method to **execute based upon the type of the object being referred to at the time the call occurs**.

It is the **type of the object being referred to** (not the type of the reference variable) **that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed**. Therefore, if a superclass contains a method that is overridden by a subclass, then when different types of objects are referred to through a superclass reference variable, different versions of the method are executed.

```Java
//Demonstrate dynamic method dispatch
class Sup {
    void who() {
        System.out.println("who() in Sup");
    }
}

class Sub1 extends Sup {
    void who() {
        System.out.println("who() in Sub1");
    }
}

class Sub2 extends Sup {
    void who() {
        System.out.println("who() in Sub2");
    }
}

class DynDispDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Sup superOb = new Sup();
        Sub1 subOb1 = new Sub1();
        Sub2 subOb2 = new Sub2();

        Sup supRef;

        /*
         * In each case, the version of who() to call
         * is determined at run time by the type of
         * object being referred to
         */
        supRef = superOb;
        supRef.who();

        supRef = subOb1;
        supRef.who();

        supRef = subOb2;
        supRef.who();
    }
}
```

Output:\
who() in Sup\
who() in Sub1\
who() in Sub2

**The version of who( ) executed is determined by the type of object being referred to at the time of the call, not by the class type of supRef.**

## Why Overridden Methods?

**Overridden methods allow Java to support run-time polymorphism**.
Polymorphism is essential to object-oriented programming for one reason: **it allows a general class to specify methods that will be common to all of its derivatives**, while allowing subclasses to define the specific implementation of some or all of those methods.

Part of the key to successfully applying polymorphism is understanding that the **superclasses and subclasses form a hierarchy that moves from lesser to greater specialization**.

```Java
// Use dynamic method dispatch
class TwoDShape {
    private double width;
    private double height;
    private String name;

    // A default constructor
    TwoDShape() {
        width = height = 0.0;
        name = "none";
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    TwoDShape(double w, double h, String n) {
        width = w;
        height = h;
        name = n;
    }

    // Construct object with equal width and heigth
    TwoDShape(double x, String n) {
        width = height = x;
        name = n;
    }

    // Construct an object from an object
    TwoDShape(TwoDShape ob) {
        width = ob.width;
        height = ob.height;
        name = ob.name;
    }

    // Accessor methods for width and height
    double getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    double getHeight() {
        return height;
    }

    void setWidth(double w) {
        width = w;
    }

    void setHeight(double h) {
        height = h;
    }

    String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    void showDim() {
        System.out.println("Width and height are " + width + " and " + height);
    }

    // The area method defined by TwoDShape
    double area() {
        System.out.println("area() must be overriden");
        return 0.0;
    }
}

// A subclass of TwoDShape for triangles
class Triangle extends TwoDShape {
    private String style;

    // A default contructor
    Triangle() {
        super();
        style = "none";
    }

    // Constructor for Triangle
    Triangle(String s, double w, double h) {
        super(w, h, "triangle");// Call superclass constructor
        style = s;
    }

    // One argument constructor
    Triangle(double x) {
        super(x, "triangle");// call superclass constructor
        style = "filled";
    }

    // COnstruct an object from an object
    Triangle(Triangle ob) {
        super(ob); // Pass object to TwoDShape constructor
        style = ob.style;
    }

    // Override area() for Triangle
    double area() {
        return getWidth() * getHeight() / 2;
    }

    void showStyle() {
        System.out.println("Triangle is " + style);
    }
}

// A subclass of TwoDShape for rectangles.
class Rectangle extends TwoDShape {
    // A default constructor
    Rectangle() {
        super();
    }

    // Constructor for rectangle
    Rectangle(double w, double h) {
        super(w, h, "rectangle");// call superclass constructor
    }

    // Construct a square
    Rectangle(double x) {
        super(x, "rectangle");// call superclass constructor
    }

    // Construct an object from an object
    Rectangle(Rectangle ob) {
        super(ob); // pass object TwoDShape constructor
    }

    boolean isSquare() {
        if (getWidth() == getHeight())
            return true;
        return false;
    }

    // Override area() for Rectangle
    double area() {
        return getWidth() * getHeight();
    }
}

class DynShapes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TwoDShape[] shapes = new TwoDShape[5];

        shapes[0] = new Triangle("outlined", 8.0, 12.0);
        shapes[1] = new Rectangle(10);
        shapes[2] = new Rectangle(10, 4);
        shapes[3] = new Triangle(7.0);
        shapes[4] = new TwoDShape(10, 20, "generic");

        for (int i = 0; i < shapes.length; i++) {
            // The proper version of area() is called for each shape
            System.out.println("object is " + shapes[i].getName());
            System.out.println("Area is " + shapes[i].area());
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

Output:\
object is triangle\
Area is 48.0

object is rectangle\
Area is 100.0

object is rectangle\
Area is 40.0

object is triangle\
Area is 24.5

object is generic\
area() must be overriden\
Area is 0.0

**Each override of area( ) supplies an implementation that is suitable
for the type of object encapsulated by the subclass.The type of object referred to by a superclass reference variable is determined at run time and acted on accordingly. The interface to this operation is the same no matter what type of shape is being used**

## Using Abstract Classes

It is not uncommon for a method to have no meaningful definition in the context of its superclass. You can handle this situation in two ways:

- Report a warning message
- Use **_abstract methods_**

An abstract method is created by **specifying the abstract type modifier**. An abstract method **contains no body** and is, therefore, **not implemented by the superclass**. Thus, a **subclass must override it**.

To decalre an abstract method, use the general form:\
**_abstract type name(parameter-list);_**

No method body is present. The **abstract modifier** can be used only on **instance methods**. It **cannot** be applied to **static methods or to constructors**.

**When a subclass inherits an abstract class, it must implement all of the abstract methods in the superclass**

```Java
//Create an abstract class
abstract class TwoDShape {
    private double width;
    private double height;
    private String name;

    // A default constructor
    TwoDShape() {
        width = height = 0.0;
        name = "none";
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    TwoDShape(double w, double h, String n) {
        width = w;
        height = h;
        name = n;
    }

    // Construct object with equal width and heigth
    TwoDShape(double x, String n) {
        width = height = x;
        name = n;
    }

    // Construct an object from an object
    TwoDShape(TwoDShape ob) {
        width = ob.width;
        height = ob.height;
        name = ob.name;
    }

    // Accessor methods for width and height
    double getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    double getHeight() {
        return height;
    }

    void setWidth(double w) {
        width = w;
    }

    void setHeight(double h) {
        height = h;
    }

    String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    void showDim() {
        System.out.println("Width and height are " + width + " and " + height);
    }

    // Now, area() is abstract
    abstract double area();// Make area() into an abstract method
}

// A subclass of TwoDShape for triangles
class Triangle extends TwoDShape {
    private String style;

    // A default contructor
    Triangle() {
        super();
        style = "none";
    }

    // Constructor for Triangle
    Triangle(String s, double w, double h) {
        super(w, h, "triangle");// Call superclass constructor
        style = s;
    }

    // One argument constructor
    Triangle(double x) {
        super(x, "triangle");// call superclass constructor
        style = "filled";
    }

    // COnstruct an object from an object
    Triangle(Triangle ob) {
        super(ob); // Pass object to TwoDShape constructor
        style = ob.style;
    }

    // Override area() for Triangle
    double area() {
        return getWidth() * getHeight() / 2;
    }

    void showStyle() {
        System.out.println("Triangle is " + style);
    }
}

// A subclass of TwoDShape for rectangles.
class Rectangle extends TwoDShape {
    // A default constructor
    Rectangle() {
        super();
    }

    // Constructor for rectangle
    Rectangle(double w, double h) {
        super(w, h, "rectangle");// call superclass constructor
    }

    // Construct a square
    Rectangle(double x) {
        super(x, "rectangle");// call superclass constructor
    }

    // Construct an object from an object
    Rectangle(Rectangle ob) {
        super(ob); // pass object TwoDShape constructor
    }

    boolean isSquare() {
        if (getWidth() == getHeight())
            return true;
        return false;
    }

    // Override area() for Rectangle
    double area() {
        return getWidth() * getHeight();
    }
}

class AbsShape {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TwoDShape[] shapes = new TwoDShape[4];
        shapes[0] = new Triangle("outlined", 8.0, 12.0);
        shapes[1] = new Rectangle(10);
        shapes[2] = new Rectangle(10, 4);
        shapes[3] = new Triangle(7.0);
        // error: TwoDShape is abstract; cannot be instantiated
        // shapes[4] = new TwoDShape(10, 20, "generic");

        for (int i = 0; i < shapes.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("object is " + shapes[i].getName());
            System.out.println("Are is " + shapes[i].area());
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

Outpout:\
object is triangle\
Are is 48.0

object is rectangle\
Are is 100.0

object is rectangle\
Are is 40.0

object is triangle\
Are is 24.5

**It is perfectly acceptable for an abstract class to contain concrete methods which a subclass is free to use as is. Only those methods declared as abstract need be overridden by subclasses.**
